# 1PassHound

## Overview

The **1Password for Business OpenGraph** extension lets you bring your 1Password ACL data into BloodHoundâ€™s graphâ€‘analysis framework. With this extension, you can:

- **Model Your 1Password Estate**  
  Represent your business account as a graph of nodesâ€”accounts, users, groups, vaults and every kind of item (logins, secure notes, cards, etc.)â€”each decorated with its own Fontâ€¯Awesome icon and color.

- **Map Every Permission & Membership**  
  Capture all relationships with edges like `OPContains`, `OPMemberOf`, `OPViewItems`, `OPManageVault`, `OPHasItem`, `OPManageGroups` and `OPRecoverAccounts`.

- **Collect via the 1Password CLI**  
  Use the PowerShell script (`Invoke-1PassHound`) to wrap the `op` CLI, fetch Users, Groups, Vaults and Items from your local 1Password session, and emit a BloodHoundâ€‘compatible JSON file (`1pass_<accountid>.json`).

- **Visualize & Analyze in BloodHound**  
  Once imported, youâ€™ll be able to:
  - **Audit & Compliance**: Verify who really has access to which vaults or items.  
  - **Incident Response**: Trace potential exposure paths and remediate unintended permissions.  
  - **Security Reviews**: Explore group memberships, vault structures and item distribution at a glance.

Whether youâ€™re auditing permissions, responding to incidents, or simply exploring your 1Password configuration, this extension brings clarity, control and rich visualization to your vaults and items.  

## Collector Setup & Usage

1. **PowerShell Prerequisite**  
   - Requires **PowerShellÂ 3.0+** on any platform where both PowerShell and the `op` CLI run.

2. **Install the 1Password CLI**  
   - Follow the official guide to install `op` and ensure itâ€™s in your `PATH`:  
     https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-1-install-1password-cli

3. **Enable Desktopâ€‘App Integration**  
   - Turn on the 1Password desktopâ€‘app integration so the CLI can authenticate via your signedâ€‘in app:  
     https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration

4. **Authenticate**  
   - From your macOS or Windows PowerShell session, run:  
     ```powershell
     op signin <your-subdomain>
     ```  
   - This exports an `OP_SESSION_<account>` environment variable that the collector uses.

5. **Load & Run the Collector**  
   - In the repo root (where `1passhound.ps1` lives), dotâ€‘source the script so its functions become available:  
     ```powershell
     . .\1passhound.ps1
     ```  
   - Then execute the main function:  
     ```powershell
     Invoke-1PassHound
     ```  
   - By default, this will emit a BloodHoundâ€‘compatible JSON graph named:  
     ```
     1pass_<accountid>.json
     ```

6. **Dependencies**  
   - No extra PowerShell modules are requiredâ€”just builtâ€‘in cmdlets plus the `op` CLI.

7. **Platform Support**  
   - Verified on **macOS** (PowerShellÂ Core) and expected to work on **Windows PowerShellÂ 3.0+** (and PowerShell Core on Linux).
